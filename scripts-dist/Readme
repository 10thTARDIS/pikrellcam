Scripts in the scripts-dist direcotory are distribution scripts which,
except for the scripts beginning with '_', are copied to the scripts dir when
install-pikrellcam.sh is run.

Scripts in the "scripts-dist" directory should not be edited since they
are subject to being replaced when PiKrellCam is upgraded.

Scripts in the "scripts" directory are user editable and are configured to
be run from pikrellcam.conf or at-commands.conf.
